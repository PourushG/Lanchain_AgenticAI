    "Loggin is a crucial aspect of any application, providing a way to track events, errors, and operational infromation. Python's built-in logging module  offeres a flexible framework for emitting log messages from Python programs. In this lesson, we will cover the basics of logging, including how to configure loggin, log levels, and best practices for using logging in Python applicaitons."
