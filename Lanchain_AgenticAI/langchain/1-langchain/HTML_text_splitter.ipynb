    "\n",
    "HTMLHeaderTextSplitter is a \"structure-aware\" chunk that spolits text at the HTML element level and adds metadata for each header \"relevant\" to any given chunk. It can return chunks element by eomeent or combine elements with the sam emetadata, with the objectives of (a) keeping related text grouped (more or less) semantically and (b) preserving context-rich information encoded in document structures. It can be used with other text splitter as a part of a chunking pipeline"
