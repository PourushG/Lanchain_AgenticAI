Still, this is a great way to get started with LangChain - a lot of features can be built with just some prompting and an LLM call."

    "What is LCEL?\n",
    "\n",
    "LCEL stands for LangChain Expression Language.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is a special language (or syntax) used inside LangChain to build AI pipelines step-by-step in a clean, readable, and modular way.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of it as a tool that lets you connect different AI components like Lego blocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Load text\n",
    "\n",
    "Split into chunks\n",
    "\n",
    "Add embeddings\n",
    "\n",
    "Search\n",
    "\n",
    "Ask an LLM\n",
    "\n",
    "Format the output\n",
    "\n",
    "LCEL lets you combine these steps neatly.\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ Why is LCEL used?\n",
    "\n",
    "Without LCEL, building AI pipelines becomes:\n",
    "\n",
    "messy\n",
    "\n",
    "long\n",
    "\n",
    "full of repeated code\n",
    "\n",
    "harder to debug\n",
    "\n",
    "LCEL solves this by letting you:\n",
    "\n",
    "✔ Connect steps like a flow\n",
    "✔ Keep code short and readable\n",
    "✔ Run pipelines sync or async\n",
    "✔ Easily swap components (LLM, embedding model, vector store)\n",
    "✔ Reuse the same pipeline for multiple tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "It is basically clean code for AI workflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ Where is LCEL used?\n",
    "\n",
    "LCEL is used in LangChain-based AI applications, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "🔹 RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) systems\n",
    "\n",
    "– search documents → feed to LLM → format answer\n",
    "\n",
    "🔹 Chatbots\n",
    "\n",
    "– detect intent → generate response → store memory\n",
    "\n",
    "🔹 Agent workflows\n",
    "\n",
    "– define tools → route decisions → call LLM → return results\n",
    "\n",
    "🔹 Knowledge-base apps\n",
    "\n",
    "– load PDFs → embed text → retrieve relevant info\n",
    "\n",
    "🔹 LLM tool pipelines\n",
    "\n",
    "– parse input → run multiple tools → combine results\n",
    "\n",
    "Essentially, everywhere you want to structure data flow between AI components.\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ When is LCEL used?\n",
    "\n",
    "You use LCEL when:\n",
    "\n",
    "✔ You want to chain multiple steps together\n",
    "\n",
    "(example: loader → splitter → embeddings → vector search → LLM)\n",
    "\n",
    "✔ You want a clean, readable pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "Not scattered code.\n",
    "\n",
    "✔ You want reusability\n",
    "\n",
    "One pipeline can be reused for many queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "✔ You want to build production-ready AI apps\n",
    "\n",
    "Because LCEL supports streaming, batching, async, and parallel execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "✔ You want to modify pipelines easily\n",
    "\n",
    "Just replace one block (like swapping OpenAI with Llama).\n",
    "\n",
    "🎯 Simple Analogy\n",
    "\n",

    "Add tea leaves\n",
    "\n",
    "Add sugar\n",

    "Add milk\n",
    "\n",
    "Strain\n",
    "\n",
    "Serve\n",
    "\n",
    "LCEL lets you write these steps as:\n",
    "\n",
    "boil | addTea | addSugar | addMilk | strain | serve\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of writing a long, complicated function.\n",
    "\n",
    "🧠 In summary\n",
    "Question\tAnswer\n",
    "What is LCEL?\tA syntax in LangChain to connect AI steps like a pipeline.\n",
    "Why used?\tMakes AI workflows clean, modular, fast, and reusable.\n",
    "Where used?\tRAG systems, chatbots, agents, embedding pipelines, tool workflows.\n",
    "When used?\tWhenever multiple AI steps need to be combined in a structured way."
